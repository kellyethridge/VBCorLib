<h4>Example</h4>
The following code demonstrates how to search for a value in an <b>ArrayList</b> using BinarySearch.
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    Dim list As New ArrayList
    Dim i As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 5
        list.Add i * 2
    Next i
    
    '' Display the current values in the list
    Console.WriteLine "The ArrayList contains:"
    PrintValues list
    
    '' Find a non-existing value
    FindValue list, 7
    
    '' Find an existing value
    FindValue list, 4
    
    Console.ReadLine
End Sub

Private Sub PrintValues(ByVal en As IEnumerable)
    Dim v As Variant
    
    Console.WriteValue vbTab
    
    For Each v In en
        Console.WriteValue "{0} ", v
    Next v
    Console.WriteLine
End Sub

Private Sub FindValue(ByVal list As ArrayList, ByVal value As Variant)
    Dim Index As Long
    
    Index = list.BinarySearch(value)
    
    If Index < 0 Then
        Console.WriteLine "The value ({0}) was not found in the list. The next largest value was found at index {1}.", value, Not Index
    Else
        Console.WriteLine "the value ({0}) was found at index {1}.", value, Index
    End If
End Sub

'' This code produces the following output.
''
'' The ArrayList contains:
''     2 4 6 8 10
'' The value (7) was not found in the list. the next largest value was found at index 3.
'' The value (4) was found at index 1.
