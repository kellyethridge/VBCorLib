@remarks The following example demonstrates how to write output to
the console using the <b>WriteLine</b> method. There are 3 ways to
use the <b>WriteLine</b> method effectively, and they are shown below.
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    '' writes a NewLine to the console
    Console.WriteLine
    
    '' writes a string followed by a NewLine
    Console.WriteLine "Hello"
    
    '' writes a formatted string using the
    '' supplied parameters, followed by a NewLine
    Console.WriteLine "Hello, {0}", "Kelly"
    
    Console.WriteLine "Press Return"
    Console.ReadLine    '' waits for return key to continue
    
    '' The above code outputs
    ''
    '' (Blank Line)
    '' Hello
    '' Hello, Kelly
    '' Press Return
End Sub
</pre>
As you can see, the <b>WriteLine</b> method accepts a variaty of
parameters to create differently formatted outputs to the Console.
The first parameter is the string to be written to the console, while
any additional parameters are used by formatting information within
the first parameter.
