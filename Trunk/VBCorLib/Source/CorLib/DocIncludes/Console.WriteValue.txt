<h4>Example</h4>
In this example, the WriteValue function is used to display a sequence
of values. The values are all written to the same line because WriteValue
does not include a NewLine character after writing a value. A NewLine
character has to be manually added to advance to the next line.
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    Dim i As Long
    
    '' Writes out a sequence of digits. The digits
    '' are written on the same line.
    Console.WriteValue "Loop 1: "
    For i = 1 To 5
        Console.WriteValue i
    Next i
    
    '' Writes out a new line manually.
    Console.WriteValue vbCrLf
    
    '' Writes formatted values on the same line.
    Console.WriteValue "Loop 2: "
    For i = 1 To 5
        Console.WriteValue "i = {0}" & IIf(i < 5, ", ", ""), i
    Next i
    
'' The outputs from the loops are
'' Loop 1: 12345
'' Loop 2: i = 1, i = 2, i = 3, i = 4, i = 5
End Sub
</pre>
As shown, the first loop writes 5 digits to the console, each digit
following the previous digit on the same line. WriteValue does not
include line-breaks. A manual line-break is written to achieve the
effect of advancing to the next line. The second loop uses a formatted
value output. The argument is substituted in the formatted value and
then written to the output onto the same single line. A comma is added
to distinguish each iteration though the loop.
