<h4>Example</h4>
This examples shows how to continually read a line of characters from the
Console keyboard. The function will block and wait for a NewLine (Return Key)
is reached. All characters are returned not including the the NewLine characters.
<pre>
    Dim s As String
    
    '' Reads all of the characters upto a NewLine break.
    '' If there are no characters (including NewLine) in the
    '' buffer, then the function will block and wait.
    s = Console.ReadLine
    
    '' Exit the loop if an empty line is returned.
    Do While Len(s) > 0
        Debug.Print s
        DoEvents
        
        '' Continue reading an entire line at once. If no
        '' characters are available, then the function will
        '' block until the return key is pressed.
        s = Console.ReadLine
    Loop
</pre>
As shown here, the loop continually reads in an entire line of characters
until an empty line is returned. The function blocks when no characters remain
to be read in from the console input. The NewLine characters are not returned
with the line.
