<h4>Example</h4>
This example shows how to read input from the console keyboard. 
The Read function will block and wait for the return key to be
pressed before returning. If there are characters already in the
input stream, the function does not block and returns the next character.
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    Dim ch As Long
    
    '' reads from the console keyboard. The function
    '' will block until the return key is pressed.
    ch = Console.Read
    
    '' we will loop through the characters typed into
    '' the console and exit the loop when CTRL+Z followed
    '' by Return is pressed.
    Do While ch &lt&gt 26
        Debug.Print Chr$(ch);
        DoEvents
        
        '' As long as there are characters remaining to be
        '' from the console keyboard, this function won't block.
        ch = Console.Read
    Loop
End Sub
</pre>
As shown here, the loop just retrieves characters from the console
keyboard one character at a time. If there are no more characters
in the buffer, then the Read function will block and wait for the
Return key to be pressed again. The key combination of CTRL+Z (26)
is used as an exit from the loop. CRTL+Z is what is used
to signal the end of a file on unix platforms.
