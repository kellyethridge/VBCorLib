' Module: FileSystemInfo
'

''
' The FileSystemInfo interface is used to access both FileInfo and DirectoryInfo
' objects using the same code. This allows for similar properties and methods
' to be used on both files and directories with a single routine.
'
Option Explicit

''
' Flags used to indicate properties of a file or directory.
'
' @param ReadOnly The file or directory can only be read from.
' @param Hidden The file or directory is to be hidden in normal file listings.
' @param System The file or directory is system object and caution should be used.
' @param DirectoryAttr The object is a directory.
' @param Archive The file or directory is marked for backup.
' @param Device Reserved for future use.
' @param Normal The file is normal and has no other attributes set. This attribute is valid only if used alone.
' @param Temporary The file is temporary. File systems attempt to keep all of the data in memory for quicker access rather than flushing the data back to mass storage. A temporary file should be deleted by the application as soon as it is no longer needed.
' @param SparseFile The file is a sparse file. Sparse files are typically large files whose data are mostly zeros.
' @param ReparsePoint The file contains a reparse point, which is a block of user-defined data associated with a file or a directory.
' @param Compressed The file is compressed.
' @param Offline The file is offline. The data of the file is not immediately available.
' @param NotContentIndexed The file will not be indexed by the operating system's content indexing service.
' @param Encrypted The file or directory is encrypted. For a file, this means that all data in the file is encrypted. For a directory, this means that encryption is the default for newly created files and directories.
