** UNIT TESTS **
This is a set of unit tests that can test the integrity of the VBCorLib
classes. In order to load and run these tests, the SimplyVBUnit v1.4.x
test harness must be install on the system. This harness can be downloaded
from www.pscode.com or www.sourceforge.net/projects/simplyvbunit. 

The loading of this project is not necessary to load and compile VBCorLib.
