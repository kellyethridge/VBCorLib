** TYPE LIBRARIES **
These type libraries are required to compile CorLib source files.
They must be registered in order to be recognized by VB.

The VBVM6Lib.tlb is a modified version of the original file found at
www.xbeat.net/vbspeed. This version is fully compatible with the
original version, but includes additional methods use by CorLib.

To build the CorLib.odl file requires using MKTYPLIB.EXE which
is included with VB6. The file is not compatible with MIDL.EXE.
