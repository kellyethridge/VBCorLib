' @remarks An encoder needs to hold multiple encoded resources. Once all resources
' have been encoded, each resource will be requested one at a time. The same
' resource should never be returned more than once.

' Encodes a value into a byte array for later retrieval.
'
' @param Value The value to be encoded into a resource compatible byte array.
' @param ResourceName The identifier for the specific resource. Should be converted to a string or numeric value.
' @param ResourceType The type of resource. This can be a string or numeric value. If the is value is not supplied, then an attempt to determine the type should be made based on the Value itself.
' @param LanguageID The Locale identifier this resource belongs to. If this value is not supplied, then the current culture's LCID should be used.
' @return Returns <b>True</b> if the encoder accepted and encoded the value, <b>False</b> otherwise.
' @remarks This function should not throw an exception. If the encoder cannot handle the the value for encoding, it should just return <b>False</b>.
