@remarks As items are added, the capacity is increased as necessary. The items
are appended to the end of the list and maintain the order they were added,
provided no other method is used to change the order, such as <a href="ArrayList.Insert.html">Insert</a> or <a href="ArrayList.Remove.html">Remove</a>.

@example
In the following example, several items are added to an <b>ArrayList</b> object and then iterated over, displaying the items in the list.
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    Dim list As New ArrayList
    
    '' add several elements to the ArrayList
    list.Add "Humpty"
    list.Add "Dumpty"
    list.Add "sat"
    list.Add "on"
    list.Add "a"
    list.Add "wall."
    
    '' Display the contents of the ArrayList
    PrintValues list
    
    '' Wait for user to press return key
    Console.ReadLine
    
End Sub

Private Sub PrintValues(ByVal en As IEnumerable)
    Const Space As String = " "
    
    Dim value As Variant
    
    '' Iterate over the list
    For Each value In en
        '' Write each value onto the same line
        Console.WriteValue value
        Console.WriteValue Space
    Next value
End Sub

'' This code produces the following output.
''
'' Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
</pre>
The items are added to the list, then a For..Each statement is used
to iterate over the list, displaying the name in the Console window.
