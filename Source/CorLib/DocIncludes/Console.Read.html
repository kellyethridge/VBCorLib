@examples This example shows how to read input from the console keyboard. The Read function will block and wait for the return key to be pressed before returning. If there are characters already in the input stream, the function does not block and returns the next character.

As shown here, the loop just retrieves characters from the console
keyboard one character at a time. If there are no more characters
in the buffer, then the Read function will block and wait for the
Return key to be pressed again. The key combination of CTRL+Z (26)
is used as an exit from the loop. CRTL+Z is what is used
to signal the end of a file on unix platforms.
