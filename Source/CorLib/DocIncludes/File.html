@remarks Use the <b>File</b> class for typical operations such as copying, moving, renaming, creating, opening, deleting, and appending to files. You can also use the <b>File</b> class to get and set file attributes or date and time information related to the creation, access, and writing of a file.
<p>Many of the <b>File</b> methods return other I/O types when you create or open files. You can use these other types to further manipulate a file. For more information, see specific <b>File</b> members such as <a href="File.OpenText.html">OpenText</a>, <a href="File.CreateText.html">CreateText</a>, or <a href="File.Create.html">Create</a>.</p>
<p>Because all <b>File</b> methods are static, it might be more efficient to use a <b>File</b> method rather than a corresponding <a href="FileInfo.html">FileInfo</a> instance method if you want to perform only one action. All <b>File</b> methods require the path to the file that you are manipulating.</p>
<p>By default, full read/write access to new files is granted to all users.</p>
<p>The following table describes the enumerations that are used to customize the behavior of various <b>File</b> methods.</p>
<table style="width: auto">
	<tr>
		<th>Enumeration</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="FileStream.FileAccess.html">FileAccess</a></td>
		<td>Specifies read and write access to a file.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="FileStream.FileShare.html">FileShare</a></td>
		<td>Specifies the level of access permitted for a file that is already in use.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="FileStream.FileMode.html">FileMode</a></td>
		<td>Specifies whether the contents of an existing file are preserved or overwritten, and whether requests to create an existing file cause an exception.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<table style="width: auto">
	<tr>
		<th>Note</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>In members that accept a path as an input string, that path must be well-formed or an exception is raised. For example, if a path is fully qualified but begins with a space, the path is not trimmed in methods of the class. Therefore, the path is malformed and an exception is raised. Similarly, a path or a combination of paths cannot be fully qualified twice. For example, "c:\temp c:\windows" also raises an exception in most cases. Ensure that your paths are well-formed when using methods that accept a path string.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In members that accept a path, the path can refer to a file or just a directory. The specified path can also refer to a relative path or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for a server and share name. For example, all the following are acceptable paths:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"c:\MyDir\MyFile.txt"</li>
	<li>"c:\MyDir"</li>
	<li>"MyDir\MySubDir"</li>
	<li>"\\MyServer\MyShare"</li>
</ul>
@examples The following example demonstrates how to use the <b>File</b> class to check whether a file exists, and depending on the result, either create a new file and write to it, or open the existing file and read from it.
