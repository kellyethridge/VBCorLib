@remarks A path can contain absolute or relative location information. Absolute paths fully specify a location: the file or directory can be uniquely identified regardless of the current location. Relative paths specify a partial location: the current location is used as the starting point when locating a file specified with a relative path. To determine the current directory, call <a href="Directory.GetCurrentDirectory.html">Directory.GetCurrentDirectory</a>.
<p>Most members of the <b>Path</b> class do not interact with the file system and do not verify the existence of the file specified by a path
string. <b>Path</b> class members that modify a path string, such as <a href="Path.ChangeExtension.html">ChangeExtension</a>, have no effect on names of files in the file system. <b>Path</b> members do, however, validate the contents of a specified path string, and throw an <a href="ArgumentException.html">ArgumentException</a> if the string contains characters that are not valid in path strings, as defined in <a href="Path.Get.InvalidPathChars.html">InvalidPathChars</a>.</p>
<p>The members of the <b>Path</b> class enable you to quickly and easily perform common operations such as determining whether a file name extension is part of a path, and combining two strings into one path name.</p>

      <th>Note</th>

  <tr>
   	<td>
       In members that accept a path as an input string, that path must be well-formed or an exception is raised. For example, if a path is fully qualified but begins with a space, the path is not trimmed in methods of the class. Therefore, the path is malformed and an exception is raised. Similarly, a path or a combination of paths cannot be fully qualified twice. For example, "c:\temp c:\windows" also raises an exception in most cases. Ensure that your paths are well-formed when using methods that accept a path string.
   	</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In members that accept a path, the path can refer to a file or just a directory. The specified path can also refer to a relative path or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for a server and share name. For example, all the following are acceptable paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"c:\MyDir\MyFile.txt"</li>
  <li>"c:\MyDir"</li>
  <li>"MyDir\MySubDir"</li>
  <li>"\\MyServer\MyShare"</li>
</ul>
<p>Because all these operations are performed on strings, it is impossible to verify that the results are valid in all scenarios. For example, the <a href="Path.GetExtension.html">GetExtension</a> method parses a string that you pass to it and returns the extension from that string. However, this does not mean that a file with that extension exists on the disk.</p>
@examples The following code example demonstrates some of the main members of the <b>Path</b> class.
