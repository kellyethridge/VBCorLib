' Module: MemoryStream
'

''
' Provides an in-memory stream of data that can be read/written and modified
' using <a href="Stream.html">Stream</a> methods.
'
' @remarks <p>The <b>MemoryStream</b> uses an array of bytes to back the data
' in memory. When the object is first created, no array is allocated until the
' first time the data must be accessed. The default capacity of the array is 4096 bytes.
' The capacity will grow by doubling the size of the current capacity.
' If The capacity needs to be larger, consider setting the <a href="MemoryStream.Let.Capacity.html">Capacity</a> directly to prevent
' the array from having to be resized as new data is written to the stream.</p>
' <p>If the <b>MemoryStream</b> is created using a supplied <b>Byte</b> array, then no internal array
' will be allocated. The <b>MemoryStream</b> will access the supplied <b>Byte</b> array as if it
' were created by the <b>MemoryStream</b> object. As the underlying array is modified, the
' changes can be seen by directly accessing the array. Also, by modifying the array
' directly, the underlying stream will reflect the new data.</p>
' <p>The <b>Currency</b> type is used for consistency across all stream objects.
' Internally, the <b>MemoryStream</b> only supports 2 ^ 31 bytes. Other streams may support more.</p>
' @caution
' If a <b>Byte</b> array is being supplied to the <b>MemoryStream</b> and <i>Mode</i> is <a href="MemoryStream.BufferMode.html">ShareMode</a>,
' then the array must out-live the <b>MemoryStream</b> object. It is the responsibility of the user to
' destroy the array after the stream has been destroyed. The <b>MemoryStream</b> object
' maintains a reference to the same array in memory, but does not deallocate the
' array when finished. While the object is alive, the array is locked to prevent
' it from being ReDimed or Erased. Closing the stream will release the lock and
' reference to the array, at which point the user has full control of the array.
