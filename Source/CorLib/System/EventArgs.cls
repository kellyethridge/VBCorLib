' Represents the base class for classes that contain event data, and provides a value to use for events that do not include event data.
'
' @remarks This class serves as the base class for all classes that represent event data. To create a custom event data class, create a
' class that implements from the <b>EventArgs</b> class and provide the properties to store the necessary data. The name of your custom
' event data class should end with <b>EventArgs</b>.
' <p>To pass an object that does not contain any data, use the <a href="EventArgsStatic.Get.EmptyArgs.html">EmptyArgs</a> field.</p>

' An example would be if this class contained a Name property
' and equality is determined by the names.

' @param Value The value to compare this instance to.
