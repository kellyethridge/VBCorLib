' Module: IComparable
'

''
' Defines a generalized type-specific comparison method that a value type or class implements to order or sort its instances.
'
' @remarks This interface is implemented by types whose values can be ordered or sorted. It requires that implementing types define a single method,
' <a href="IComparable.CompareTo.html">CompareTo(Value)</a>, that indicates whether the position of the current instance in the sort order is
' before, after, or the same as a second object of the same type. The instance's <b>IComparable</b> implementation is called automatically by methods such
' as <a href="CorArray.Sort.html">CorArray.Sort</a> and <a href="ArrayList.Sort.html">ArrayList.Sort</a>.
' <p>The implementation of the <a href="IComparable.CompareTo.html">CompareTo(Value)</a> method must return a 32-bit integer that has one of three values, as shown in the following table.</p>
' <table style="width: auto">
'   <tr>
'       <th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th>
'   </tr>
'   <tr>
'       <td>Less than zero</td><td>The current instance precedes the value specified by the <a href="IComparable.CompareTo.html">CompareTo</a> method in the sort order.</td>
'   </tr>
'   <tr>
'       <td>Zero</td><td>This current instance occurs in the same position in the sort order as the value specified by the <a href="IComparable.CompareTo.html">CompareTo</a> method.</td>
'   </tr>
'   <tr>
'       <td>Greater than zero</td><td>This current instance follows the object specified by the <a href="IComparable.CompareTo.html">CompareTo</a> method in the sort order.</td>
'   </tr>
' </table>
' <p>All number types (such as <b>Long</b> and <b>Double</b>) are supported by the default <a href="Comparer.html">Comparer</a>, as are <b>String</b> and <b>Date</b>.
' Custom types should also provide their own implementation of <b>IComparable</b> to enable object instances to be ordered or sorted.</p>

' Compares the current instance with another object of the same type and returns an integer that indicates whether the current instance precedes, follows, or occurs in the same position in the sort order as the other object.
'
' @param Value A value to compare with this instance.
' @return A value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared. The return value has these meanings:
